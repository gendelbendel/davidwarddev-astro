Decided today to take the dive to update [space-charts (Blackbody Radiation interactive)](/posts/project-blackbody-radiation) to use Typescript!

I could definitely see how this would be a large undertaking in a bigger project, so this didn't take too long. However, it was quite tedious to do.

## Lessons learned

- Just... start the project with Typescript. Just do it.
