## Summary

Sometimes, it's just the small things that add up to make things better for everyone.

## The project

I stumbled across a [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) plugin for giving a little bit more power to code blocks, like line highlighting and custom line counts, called [rehype-pretty-code](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code).

You can see a demo and look at the docs on their [deployed app](https://rehype-pretty-code.netlify.app/).

## The feature in question

It recently got a contribution that expanded upon its current feature set for setting the starting line number when you request showing line numbers, like so:

````markdown
```js showLineNumbers{3}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```
````

Which when rendered, looks like so:

```js showLineNumbers{3}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```

You'll notice that it starts on the line 3 when beginning the code block. Great!

It also has an ability to highlight a specific line number as well, like so:

````markdown
```js {1}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```
````

Which when rendered, looks like so:

```js {1}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```

You'll notice that the first line is highlighted in the browser. Great!

## The problem

Something I noticed was when using _both_ of these features at the same time, depending on how you authored your markdown, you may experience issues with line highlighting not respecting the number you set.

### Example 1: `showLineNumbers` followed by `{x}`

For example, when using `showLineNumbers` followed by `{x}`:

````markdown
```js showLineNumbers{3} {2}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```
````

Which when rendered, looks like so:

```js showLineNumbers{3} {2}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```

You will observe the bug: the second line (labeled `4) is not highlighted, as would be expected.

> Note:
> You will not observe the bug once the fix is in place.

### Example 2: `{x}` followed by `showLineNumbers`

````markdown
```js {2} showLineNumbers{3}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```
````

Which when rendered, looks like so:

```js {2} showLineNumbers{3}
const test = 1;
const test2 = 2;
```

You will _not_ observe the bug: the second line (labeled `4) is not highlighted, as would be expected.

## The bug in the code

I found where the issue was: There was a regex that was a little too greedy and not taking into account the newly added `showLineNumbers` feature:

```js {2} showLineNumbers{200}
const lineNumbers = meta ? rangeParser(meta.match(/{(.*)}/)?.[1] ?? "") : [];
```

## The fix

So how do we fix it? Well, the simplest way is that since there are no other options that use the `{}` characters, we look to see if the character before a `{` is _not_ a whitespace, and if so we ignore that group and keep searching.

```js {2} showLineNumbers{200} title="the fix"
const lineNumbers = meta
  ? rangeParser(meta.match(/(?:^|\s){(.*?)/)?.[1] ?? "")
  : [];
```

The addition of the `(?:^|\s)` and adding a `?` in the capture group is the key part!

### Adding tests

But we wouldn't be a good dev _or_ tester if we didn't also add tests that cover this!

Turns out they are using snapshot testing, which accepts a markdown file as fixture input, and expected results with the same name, but in an html file, corresponding to what html the plugin would generate exactly.

So, we added a markdown file with a very similar set of data as we showed in [the problem](#the-problem), and then used one of the existing results html as a template and modified data according to what the markdown contained...

And the tests passed!

## Impact and severity

This is a pretty minor bug in the grand scheme of things, with rather low severity, but still a bug and the fix wasn't terribly hard, either.

Always strive for quality, and leave things better than you found them.
