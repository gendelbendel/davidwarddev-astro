Want to learn more about how stars get their color? I made a site to do that!

It is certainly not the first of its kind, but I wanted to explore using React and the chart.js library to create something that interests me in astronomy.

Fun fact: Stars cannot be green. Explore the "About" section of the app to find out why!
