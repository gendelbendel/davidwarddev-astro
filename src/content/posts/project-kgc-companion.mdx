I used to play a mobile game called [King God Castle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/king-god-castle/id1526791430), an RPG gatcha game where character development and team formations were a pivital point to your success in the game.

If you had a bad team, or placed your team in the map in an inefficient way, there was a high likelihood you were going to lose, and with the game's Food system (the resource you spend to go into a mission) being tied directly to time or real cash dollars spent, you want your attempts to be as successful as possible.

Enter this tool.

## Tech

I really wanted to explore using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Liveview](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html) for this project. I also use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

## Features

- [Formation Builder](https://kgc-companion.fly.dev/formation/new)
  - Drag and drop heroes from the Hero Pool up into the Formation Zone
  - Name your team formation
  - Accidentally dragged a hero you don't need? Drag it into the Trash Zone
  - Export formation to image
    - Uses javascript canvas library to generate a PNG of the Formation Zone. (Note: Quite buggy)
- [Team Builder](https://kgc-companion.fly.dev/team/new)
  - Export formation to image
    - Uses javascript canvas library to generate a PNG of the full Team Builder screen. (Note: Quite buggy)
  - Meta details
    - Name your team, give it a description (such as item priority), and designate which game mode the team is for by selecting a purpose
  - Altars
    - Use single arrows (+/- 1 point) or double arrows (+/- 5 points) to choose
  - Team
    - Choose each hero, including their Barracks level, awakening, and relic stat priority
  - Relics
    - Choose both relics and their tier, as well as whether they are required for the comp or not

## Updates

- <DateFormat date="2022-10-01" />: As I no longer play the game, I will not be
  updating it any further. As such, I have also let the [old
  domain](https://kgc-companion.com) expire.
