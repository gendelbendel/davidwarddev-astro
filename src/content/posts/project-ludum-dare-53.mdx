## Only 72 hours to make a game!

Yep. That's [Ludum Dare! Number 53](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53/packages-please-1).

## Full breakdown and retrospective

This is TBD, as there was a LOT learned! But I want to be thorough. When I do create it, I will backlink from this post.

Until then... Enjoy the project. Scroll to the bottom for links.

## Game Features

- Multiple input support, and key icon changes depending on last used input
- Randomly generated customers - Always see a new face!
- Increasing difficulty - More rules get added over time
- Earning money to be able to afford rent... No government subsidies for you.
- Days - How long can you last until life is finally unafforable?
- Depressing random quotes from the poor citizens of the city with each parcel.

## Updates

- <DateFormat date="2023-05-01" />: I have updated this blog post to include the
  details of the project. I plan to write a full breakdown of how the 72 hours
  went in a new blog post in a future date.
