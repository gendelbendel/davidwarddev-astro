Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## Code blocks

Markdown usage, prefix code block with something like:
`js {3} title="testing.js" showLineNumbers`

````markdown
```js {3} title="testing.js" showLineNumbers
console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};
```
````

### 1 digit

```js {3} title="testing.js" showLineNumbers
console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};
```

### 2 digits

```js {7} title="testing.js" showLineNumbers
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};
```

### 3 digits

```js {7} title="testing.js" showLineNumbers
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");
const test = 1;
const test2 = 3;
const test3 = 3;

console.log("ok");

const lmao = (yep) => {
  const ok = () => {
    yep.avi();
  };
};

lmao("idk");

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!
